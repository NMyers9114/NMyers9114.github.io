    <h1>The Picture of Dorian Gray and David Bowie: wearing a “mask” for the public.</h1>
    <p>	As I was watching the homework assigned for February 2nd, I was thinking about what exactly I could say about Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray and if I could possibly tie it into an overarching theme for the class. And as I watched David Bowie’s The Mask (a Mime) performance, I realized that the plot of that three minute video almost matched the plot of The Picture of Dorian Gray, at least down to the rudimentary details. In this video, David Bowie mimes a skit where the protagonist finds a mask in a junk shop that eventually consumes him by the end. In a similar vein, The Picture of Dorian Gray follows Dorian as he embeds his soul into a painting of himself, allowing the painting to grow old and corrupt as his body remains pure. This was all for the purpose of being able to stay young and appear pure while he did bad things. The connection may not be apparent initially, but when you look at it more, similarities start to arise.</p>
    <p>Dorian initially has no desire to dawn a “mask” at the start of the novel. It is only when Lord Henry warns him that he will become old and ugly one that he has the wish:</p>
    <blockquote>“How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrid, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it was only the other way! If it was I who were to be always young, and the picture that were to grow old! For this– for this–I would give everything! Yes: there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!” (Wilde 82).</blockquote>
    <p>This wish was initially to just appear young forever; there is no implication that Dorian saw this painting of himself, reasoning that it could also shield himself from appearing corrupt as he followed Lord Henry’s advice. Reading back over Lord Henry’s incessant (and extraordinarily annoying) speech to Dorian, growing old seemed to be the one thing that Dorian was troubled by, especially when Lord Henry is telling him things like this: </p>
    <blockquote>“But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memories of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we did not dare to yield to.” (Wilde 79).</blockquote>
    <p>The impressionable young Dorian took this to heart, evident by the mention in the next passage as he watched a bumble bee “with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion… or when some sudden thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain” (Wilde 79). This is the point in which Dorian is convinced that social desirability is directly linked to looks/youth, and because of this, wishes his painting would grow old instead of him.</p>
    <p>At this point, when his soul becomes linked to the painting. This is where he dawns “the mask,” or rather, he becomes the mask. The painting is who he really is: old, corrupted, and ugly. But his body is what he wants to be, or how he wants to present himself to the world. It’s his persona. It’s akin to the way that David Bowie portrays the protagonist in “The Mask (The Mime)” whenever he puts on the mask: he gains confidence, and everyone around him laughs. When wearing these masks, both Dorian Gray and the protagonist portrayed by Bowie are sensations, being able to masquerade behind a persona while hiding the “real them” behind this mask.</p>
    <p>By the end of both, the mask consumes them: David Bowie’s protagonist in the sense he became completely indistinguishable from the mask, and Dorian Gray in the sense that destroying the painting removed the mask, making him unpalletable to social life and causing him to turn the knife on himself. Both of these stories connect in the sense that, at some point, the mask consumes them, and changes who they are as a person. Dorian Gray had the chance to develop the character of his mask, those consequences reflecting onto his painting and making him ugly. </p>
    <p>Juxtaposing David Bowie’s mime performance alongside The Picture of Dorian Gray lets these connections shine, and puts Oscar Wilde’s work in a different context, while also building a stronger connection between him and David Bowie for our class.</p>
