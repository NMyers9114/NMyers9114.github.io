    <h1> David Bowie and Reinvention</h1>

    <p>Our three “protagonists” of this class, so to speak, all have one thing in common: an identity that is “performative”. It’s in the name, after all. Oscar Wilde put on a lavish, borderline posh persona that involved art as nothing more nuanced than eye candy. Edith Wharton criticized the machine she was a cog in, portraying the New York high life as something “guilded”: made to look pretty, but hides the rot. David Bowie went through plenty of stage personas, all of them completely different from each other, as well as Bowie himself. The Beyond the Beat podcast detailed David Bowie and his constant self-reinvention through the lens of music as a whole:</p>
    <blockquote>“What's the key to a musician's staying power and longevity? Is it raw talent, good looks, unconditional love from a legion of adoring fans? Sure, all three of those traits can go hand in hand with luck to prevent a flame from burning out too early. True staying power comes from reinvention. Easier said than done. All musicians feel the need to reinvent themselves lest their fans lose interest and move on to the next flavor of the week, but it needs to be balanced with a not so crazy change in case it makes their existing audience too uncomfortable. No one walked that extremely tough tightrope like David Bowie” [Beyond the Beat].</blockquote>
    <p>I disagree with this quote in the sense that “all artists need to reinvent themselves,” and “true staying power comes from reinvention.” There are countless artists who never reinvented themselves and still sell out arenas: Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osborne* are the first to come to mind. But what separates them from David Bowie is that he reinvented himself not once, but several times, all with a great degree of success. This is where the quote starts to become important: “No one walked that extremely tough tightrope like David Bowie.”</p>
    <p>The rest of the video touches on these four personas and emphasises how different they are: the pansexual alien rockstar Ziggy Stardust, the cocaine addicted fascist Thin White Duke, the artsy, almost neutral Pierrot the Sad Clown, and the thanatophobic Button Eyes. All of these personas are vastly different from each other, yet with each reinvention, his influence still seeps across the musical world and influenced genres such as punk, post-punk, and new romantic movement. </p>
    <p>Although this quote seems to misrepresent exactly why Bowie reinvented himself several times. The general consensus among critics seems to be that he constantly got bored of his former style/character, and switched to something completely different (as his progression in the video portrays). Although, we see in the song Changes lyrics which advocate for reinvention and “turning to face the strange”:</p>
    <blockquote>“Still don't know what I was waiting for, And my time was running wild, A million dead-end streets, Every time I thought I'd got it made, It seemed the taste was not so sweet, So I turned myself to face me, But I've never caught a glimpse, Of how the others must see the faker, I'm much too fast to take that test” [Bowie].</blockquote>
    <p>This excerpt effectively features that boredom with the “same”, and through it, finds reinvention as a sense of liberation, and growth. This, in a way, explains not only his constant reinventions, but why they’re so successful. Unlike Alice Cooper or Ozzy Osborne, Bowie found a creative strength in changing personas and style every so often. It’s why critics have praised his new releases, even if they don’t have a consistent style with the rest of his discography: he almost seamlessly moved into different styles because it was within his mentality.</p>
    <p>In that sense, I think the thesis from the video makes sense. Not every artist really can walk that tightrope of reinvention since not every artist is willing to reinvent. But when someone like Bowie, who bases his entire life on “turning to face the strange,” he’s not balancing on a tightrope; he’s walking on solid ground.</p>

    <p>*Even though Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osborne's personas have been consistent over time, their music HAS changed and adapted over the decades. 1970's Alice Cooper sounds nothing like 1990's Alice Cooper. I would love to write an entire paper about Alice Cooper and his performative identity, this is not the time and place to explore those nuances.</p>
